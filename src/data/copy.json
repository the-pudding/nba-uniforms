You’ll usually see the home team wearing a white uniform  — unless it’s the Lakers in their famed gold jerseys) — with the away team dressed  in their predominant color. Each uniform sports the team names or home city lettered across the chest with a number below, and the teams are playing on a court with the colors and logos of the home squad. Easy as a layup."},{"type":"text","value":"Gradually though, the aesthetic traditions of pro basketball have shifted. It began quietly in the 1990s. Beyond that decade’s general aesthetic hallmarks, teams like Chicago and Charlotte rolled out alternate third jerseys in a different team color, while Milwaukee, Houston, and Atlanta brought oversized logos to their jersey chests."},{"type":"text","value":"With Adidas in charge of kitting out NBA players, the 2000s and 2010s brought us even more alternate jerseys, with more far-out designs and even sleeves. It’s an era perhaps most infamously defined by the Cleveland Cavaliers winning the epic 2016 Finals in a black sleeved shirt with a giant “C” front and center, looking more like a t-shirt than a jersey."},{"type":"text","value":"In 2017 Nike took over the contract to produce NBA jerseys and ushered in the most extreme overhaul of aesthetic standards yet. The white-at-home standard was officially eliminated; teams were now free to wear the color of their choosing. In fact, the very notion of a “home” or “away” jersey was eliminated, with Nike now classifying each team’s wardrobe into four “editions”.

But today we’ll look at how it’s unrecognizable in a literal sense — by the on-court fashion. ."},{"type":"text","value":"Turning on a random NBA game can now be a disorienting experience to the casual or even the diehard fan. The viewer may ask themselves: which team is which, again? Who’s this team in black and neon green, or a brown and teal?"},{"type":"heading","value":"Who’s in White, Again?"},{"type":"text","value":"For decades, the basketball standard was that the home team would wear a white jersey, with only occasional exceptions for teams who wore a different light color as their preferred home (most famously, the Lakers and gold). But these days, it’s quite rare to see a team wear its Association Edition jersey or any other white jerseys at home."},{"type":"text","value":"Including last season’s City Edition for Boston, which is a slightly off-white shade, home teams wore white in just 327 games, or 27% of the time. You’re actually more likely to see teams wear white on the road nowadays. On average, teams wore their white Association jerseys in nearly half of their road games — 640, to be exact — but only a quarter of their home games, an inversion of the classic “home whites” concept."},{"type":"text","value":"The <span class=geo-team></span> wore their Association jerseys as “home whites” in <span class=geo-white-at-home></span> games, and wore them on the road for <span class=geo-white-at-road></span> games."},{"type":"graphic","value":["waffle charts for home games for GEOLOCATED GLOBETROTTERS 10 years ago vs this past season.

These were once almost exclusively the domain of Lakers-in-gold home games, but this season made up 264 games, or 21% of all games this year. Owing to the popularity of both colors, the most common dual-color matchup was a black jersey against a red one; this occurred in 81 games total. True aficionados of the crayon box might take a particularly keen interest in the 105 games in which neither team wore black or white; these were most frequently blue vs. red matchups."},{"type":"graphic","value":["waffle-home-away"]},{"type":"heading","value":"New vs. Old School"},{"type":"text","value":"Individual teams in the league still have some amount of leeway for how much they color outside the lines. The Chicago Bulls, for example, have remained fairly no-nonsense with their brand since the days of Michael Jordan. Not only have their core uniforms barely changed, but they keep up with a relatively classic schedule of wearing them, wearing their white Association uniforms for 68% of home games and only 10% of their away games."},{"type":"text","value":"By contrast, the Orlando Magic wore white at home for just two games all season, preferring instead to wear one of their many blue or black options. But their white uniforms did get play on the road — worn in nearly 60% of their road games."},{"type":"text","value":"–GEOLOCATED STAT–"},{"type":"graphic","value":["beeswarm “flair” chart, with GEOLOCATED GLOBETROTTERS highlighted"]},{"type":"heading","value":"Mad Cities"},{"type":"text","value":"The most radical change in NBA aesthetics in the Nike era has been the introduction of the “City Edition” concept. Since 2017, teams have reserved their fourth jersey slot for these designs that draw inspiration not from the team’s usual colors and logo, but from other references to their home cities or states. These designs are sometimes perfect (Miami’s “Vice” series), sometimes on-the-nose (Minnesota playing Prince dressup), sometimes perplexing (Dallas in metallic gold and silver?)."},{"type":"text","value":"These uniforms are often accompanied by a matching court update, so at least the Pelicans don’t look totally out of place in their own arena when they switch to black and neon green. While these designs were seen the most in the NBA’s In-Season Tournament (known as the Emirates NBA Cup in future years), some teams sprinkle them in their usual jersey rotation throughout the year."},{"type":"text","value":"The <span class=geo-team></span> wore their City Edition jerseys in <span class=geo-city-instances></span> games during the 2023-24 season — <span class=geo-city-avg></span> the league average."},{"type":"text","value":"The chart below shows how often each team wore each edition. Some teams were happy to set tradition aside and wear their City jerseys quite often, as with the popular Spurs World’s Fair-inspired set or the Rockets’ “H-Town” design. Other teams, like the Cavaliers and Clippers, rolled out new City designs only to keep them in storage for most of the year."},{"type":"text","value":"Fan and media reviews have been mixed too. SBNation ranked the Cavaliers’ 2023–24 City Edition a “A Tier (would buy without much hesitation), while the Clippers got an “F Tier (kill it with fire)” ranking. This year SBNation ranked Toronto’s Vince Carter-inspired dino dunking jersey as the top City Edition kit, with the Celtics, Lakers, Knicks, Thunder, and Heat at the bottom.
